In the technologies sphere, We are use addressing based on location (IP, RAM LFB, FUSE, NTFS, ...), context (IPFS, BitTorrent, ...), access (encryption, signatures, DC consensus, multyside cryptopazzl, ...), naming (DNS, IPNS, ...), structured (Foreign keys, databases, Merkle treas, hash chains, ...)
